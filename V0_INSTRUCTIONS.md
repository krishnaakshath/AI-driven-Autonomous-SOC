# How to Use Vercel v0 to Generate & Deploy Your Dashboard

Since **v0.dev** is a Generative UI tool (it creates React/Next.js code) and your current project is in **Python (Streamlit)**, there are two different "deployment" concepts here. 

This guide explains how to use the **Prompt** I gave you to create a *new* high-performance frontend using v0.

## 🚀 Speed Run: From Prompt to Live Website

### Step 1: Generate the UI
1. Go to **[v0.dev](https://v0.dev)** and sign in.
2. Open the file `VERCEL_PROMPT.md` I created for you.
3. **Copy the entire code block** inside that file.
4. Paste it into the chat box at the bottom of the v0.dev page and hit **Enter**.
5. **Wait**: v0 will generate 3 different versions (A, B, C) of your Cyberpunk Dashboard.

### Step 2: Refine the Design (Interactive Mode)
If the first version isn't perfect, you can chat with it to make changes:
- *"Make the red borders glow more intensely"*
- *"Change the background to have a moving hexagonal grid"*
- *"Make the 'Live Monitoring' badge pulse faster"*

### Step 3: Deploy the Frontend (The "vo" part)
Once you are happy with the design:
1. Look at the top-right corner of the v0 interface.
2. Click the **"Publish"** or **"Deploy"** button.
3. Vercel will build that specific version and give you a live URL (e.g., `soc-dashboard-k2a.vercel.app`).

## ⚠️ Important Implementation Detail

**Critical Note:** 
v0 generates a **React/Next.js Frontend**. It does **NOT** contain your Python logic (Isolation Forest, Fuzzy C-Means, Email Alerts).

To make it a fully functional app, you would need to:
1. **Keep your Python App running** (locally or on a server) to act as the Backend API.
2. **Connect the v0 Frontend** to your Python Backend using API calls.

### Option A: Stick with Streamlit (Current Path)
If you want to keep everything in Python (simplest for Viva):
- Use the **Streamlit app** I just upgraded with the Cyberpunk theme.
- It is already running and fully integrated with your ML models.
- **To Deploy Streamlit:** Use Streamlit Cloud (share.streamlit.io) or Render/Railway.

### Option B: Hybrid (Advanced)
- **Frontend:** Deployed on Vercel (generated by v0).
- **Backend:** Your Python scripts converted to a Flask/FastAPI server.
- **Connection:** The React frontend fetches data from `your-python-api.com/get-threats`.

## ❓ Which one do you want?

- **"I just want to show the examiners the cool UI"**: Use the **v0.dev** deployed link for the visual demo, and show your local Python app for the "working logic".
- **"I want my Python app to be online"**: Deploy your current code to **Streamlit Cloud** (I can help with this).
